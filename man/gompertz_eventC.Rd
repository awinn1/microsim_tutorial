\usage{
gompertz_eventC(
  m_ind_traits,
  m_coef_ukpds_ind_traits,
  m_coef_ukpds_other_ind_traits,
  health_outcome_index
)
}
\arguments{
\item{m_ind_traits}{A numeric matrix of individual characteristics, where each
row represents an individual and columns are variables (e.g., age, biomarkers).
The first column is assumed to be \code{age}.}

\item{m_coef_ukpds_ind_traits}{A numeric matrix of the main model
coefficients. Each column corresponds to a different health outcome.}

\item{m_coef_ukpds_other_ind_traits}{A numeric matrix of ancillary parameters.
It must have two rows: the first for \code{lambda} (location) and the second for
\code{rho} (shape). Each column corresponds to a health outcome.}

\item{health_outcome_index}{An integer specifying the column index (1-based)
for the relevant health outcome in the coefficient matrices.}
}
\value{
An integer matrix of size \verb{n x 1} (where \code{n} is the number of individuals).
A value of 1 indicates the event occurred for that individual in the cycle,
and 0 indicates it did not.
}
\description{
Calculates the probability of an event within a one-year time step for a cohort
of individuals using a Gompertz proportional hazards model. This function is
implemented in C++ via RcppArmadillo for high performance.
