\title{Vectorized Logistic Event Simulation (C++)}
\usage{
logistic_eventC(
  m_ind_traits,
  m_coef_ukpds_ind_traits,
  m_coef_ukpds_other_ind_traits,
  health_outcome_index
)
}
\arguments{
\item{m_ind_traits}{A numeric matrix of individual characteristics (predictors),
where each row represents an individual.}

\item{m_coef_ukpds_ind_traits}{A numeric matrix of the main model
coefficients. Each column corresponds to a different health outcome.}

\item{m_coef_ukpds_other_ind_traits}{A numeric matrix of ancillary parameters.
The first row must contain the intercept (\code{lambda}) for each health outcome.}

\item{health_outcome_index}{An integer specifying the column index (1-based)
for the relevant health outcome in the coefficient matrices.}
}
\value{
An integer matrix of size \verb{n x 1} (where \code{n} is the number of individuals).
A value of 1 indicates the event occurred, and 0 indicates it did not.
}
\description{
Calculates the probability of a binary event for a cohort of individuals using
a logistic regression model. The event occurrence is then simulated based on
this probability. This function is implemented in C++ via RcppArmadillo
for high performance.
