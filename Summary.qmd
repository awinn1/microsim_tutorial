# About

In this file, I will write what I have done in the repo in the past few days.

# Changes

-   I have changed the folder structure so functions are defined in different folders rather than being written inside the model script.

```{r}
fs::dir_tree()
```

-   Inside the `scripts` folder, I created separate .R files for each "R version" of the model (Aaron's, Wael's and mine). I also created a folder called `functions` that stores my modified R functions with suffix `2`
-   I compared the performance of the three models and the results are shown in the image below

-   I created cpp functions and stored them inside the `cpp_functions` folder. I checked their numeric consistency with their R counterparts and they are consistent. I did not convert all functions since the rest of the functions are dependent on only these three functions: `gompertz_event`, `logisitic_event`, and `weibull_event`.
-   I ran some benchmarks in `scripts/test_individual_cpp_funs.R`
-   I created a function called `run_microsim_model()` and `run_microsim_modelC()` to run the pure R version and Rcpp version, respectively.
-   Finally, to run my work, you will need to run `scripts/UKPDS_vectorized_model_abdullah.R`

# Findings and issues

-   I checked the speed performance of the individual Rcpp functions I created and found significant improvements in speed (See `scripts/test_individual_cpp_funs.R` )

-   I checked the numeric consistecny between the R and Rcpp models in `scripts/UKPDS_vectorized_model_abdullah.R` in terms of events and death, and the numbers match.

-   What was really strange to me is the modest improvement I found when I compared the performance of `run_microsim_model()` and `run_microsim_modelC()`. I couldn't explain the issue, and I believe I would need help with this.

-   You will find two `.Rprofvis` files for diagnostics.
